Financial market simulation engine.  
There are currently three simulation enginges:  
### 1. Periodic call auction  
This market principle allows market participants to send orders before the market opens, and during the "trading" session these orders are executed when price matches.
At market open, the open price is calculated by calculating the cumulative bid and ask volume. Then trades are executed.  
My implementation uses a very simple matching algorithm, which just compares prices directly.

### 2. Continuous market trading environment  
Market participants can continuously send orders and trades are exected continuously.  
Traders can send orders before market open, and when the market opens these trades are executed. Participants can then send orders when they want.  
The market is represented as a FastAPI backend. The open price gets calculated in a similar way as the PCA environment.  
### 3. Same as above, but with GUI + much better implementation  
This uses a React frontend application alongside with the FastAPI backend, meaning one can see the order book get updated in real time. There are also two order generation algorithms being used.  

#### Details on implementation #3--  

For this implementation I've built two separate sub-implementations. The second implementation is much more realistic and uses rigorous academic concepts.  
Details:  

### 1. Price modeling  
The price direction bias does not decide the course of the actual asset price (in this case the last traded price), in the way that it automatically steers the market direction, but makes it such that the incoming orders will get placed higher or lower.  
The method I'm using here is Geometric Brownian Motion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion  
The next target price gets calculated using  
$S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t\cdot\text{exp}((\mu-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}Z)$  
Where  
$Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  
$\mu$ is the general market direction (positive means upsloping)  
$\sigma$ is the average market volatility  
$S_t$ is the price at timestamp $t$
This formula aims to simulate realictic market movements. The first term in the formula indicates general price direction, and the second one adds noise.  
### 2. Volume modeling
The volume for each trade gets sampled from a lognormal distribution, so $\text{Vol}=\text{exp}(\mu+\sigma x)$ where $x\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$
This results in larger tails than usual, and aims to simulate things like iceberg orders and occasionally very large trades.
### 3. Order frequency modeling
I decided to implement two (slightly) different approaches here:
My first idea was to use an exponential distribution to sample waiting times between each order. The waiting period $\Delta t$ gets sampled using $\Delta t=\frac{-\text{ln}(u)}{\lambda_i}$, where $\lambda_i$ is specific for participant $i$ and $u\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$.
The second option here is to sample the amount of orders coming in, during a fixed time interval $\Delta t$. This amount $N_t$ follows a poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda_i$. However, here I used a variant $\lambda$ parameter for each participant, with it being time-dependent. I used the formula $\lambda(t)=\lambda_i+A\cdot\text{sin}(\frac{2\pi}{\text{CT}-\text{OT}}(t-\text{OT}-\text{Offset})$, with OT and CT being market open time and market close time (in minutes here), respectively, and $A$ and Offset being tunable parameters. This makes the frequency of incoming orders dependent on daily activity (more activity during market open and close).
For both methods, the $\lambda_i$ parameter for each participant gets sampled from a normal distribution, with the mean and stdev being tunable.
